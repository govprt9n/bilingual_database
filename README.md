# Bilingual Database for Translation of Government Press Releases

## Description

This bilingual database (English/Chinese) is designed to enhance the quality of "GovPR Translation", an automatic translation engine for the rendition of HKSAR government press releases. The database is like a translation memory (TM). Different from conventional TMs for translators, however, it features not only sentences but also smaller units such as phrases and words extracted from the government press releases from 2016 to 2018 (DATA.GOV.HK).

The present work is also useful for translators and language professionals who would like to find bilingual sentences containing a specific expression. For example, if you are not sure how to translate the term "Chief Executive" or "把握機遇", just visit https://bit.ly/3icW8hq, type your expression in the text box there, and the bilingual examples provided may be useful.
